## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher (for simulation exercises)
- Basic programming knowledge

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd physical-ai-book
```

2. Install Docusaurus dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start a local development server and open the documentation in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Simulation Environment

The hands-on exercises in this book use PyBullet, a physics simulator for robotics. To set up the simulation environment:

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install pybullet pybullet-data numpy matplotlib
```

2. Follow the setup instructions in Chapter 1.4 for detailed configuration.
