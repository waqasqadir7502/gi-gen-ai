# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language - focus on educational value for AI beginners and humanoid robotics learners]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this educational content can be tested independently - e.g., "Students can complete the hands-on exercise and understand the concept"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student background], **When** [reading content/exercising], **Then** [learning outcome achieved]
2. **Given** [student background], **When** [completing hands-on exercise], **Then** [practical skill demonstrated]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language - focus on educational value for AI beginners and humanoid robotics learners]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this educational content can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student background], **When** [reading content/exercising], **Then** [learning outcome achieved]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language - focus on educational value for AI beginners and humanoid robotics learners]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the educational value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this educational content can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student background], **When** [reading content/exercising], **Then** [learning outcome achieved]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How does content handle different learning paces?
- What happens when students have different technical backgrounds?
- How does content adapt to various skill levels?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Content MUST be accessible to AI beginners and intermediate learners
- **FR-002**: Content MUST include practical examples, small exercises, or mini-projects
- **FR-003**: Content MUST be properly formatted for Docusaurus documentation platform
- **FR-004**: Content MUST build progressively from basic to advanced topics
- **FR-005**: Content MUST emphasize practical, implementable solutions rather than purely theoretical concepts

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Content MUST be tested with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target audience not specified - AI beginners, intermediate learners, or both?]
- **FR-007**: Content MUST maintain consistent terminology for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific terms not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Educational Content]**: [Core learning materials, exercises, and examples]
- **[Learning Path]**: [Progressive structure connecting basic to advanced concepts]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Students can complete hands-on exercises in under 30 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Content helps 90% of beginners understand core humanoid robotics concepts"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "Students successfully complete practical exercises on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Educational metric, e.g., "Content builds progressively allowing students to advance from basic to advanced topics"]
