# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Beginner-Friendly Accessibility
All content must be accessible to AI beginners and intermediate learners. Technical concepts should be explained with clear analogies, step-by-step breakdowns, and practical examples that connect theory to real-world applications in humanoid robotics.

### II. Hands-On Learning Approach
Every chapter must include practical examples, small exercises, or mini-projects that allow readers to apply concepts immediately. Theory without practice is insufficient - each concept should have corresponding hands-on activities.

### III. Docusaurus-Optimized Formatting
All content must be properly formatted for Docusaurus documentation platform with clean Markdown structure, consistent navigation, and proper integration with the site's theme and features.

### IV. Progressive Complexity Building
Content should build progressively from basic concepts to advanced topics, ensuring each chapter builds logically on previous knowledge while maintaining accessibility for readers joining at different levels.

### V. Practical Application Focus
Emphasis must be placed on practical, implementable solutions rather than purely theoretical concepts. Code examples should be functional, tested, and directly applicable to physical AI and humanoid robotics projects.

### VI. Educational Consistency
Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and teaching style across all chapters and sections to provide a unified learning experience throughout the entire book.

## Content Quality Standards
All content must meet high educational standards: explanations should be clear and jargon-free when possible, examples must be relevant to humanoid robotics applications, and mathematical concepts should be simplified unless essential for understanding. All code samples must be well-commented and tested.

## Documentation Workflow
Content creation follows a structured workflow: topic identification → outline creation → draft writing → peer review → testing of examples → publication. All content undergoes technical accuracy verification and educational effectiveness review before publication.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book. All contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes and approval from project maintainers. All content must be reviewed for compliance with accessibility and educational standards.
