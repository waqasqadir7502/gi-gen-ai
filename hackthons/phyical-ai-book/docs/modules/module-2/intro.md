# Module 2: Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the essential components and principles of humanoid robotics, including kinematics, sensing, actuation, and basic locomotion.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- Kinematics and movement systems in humanoid robots
- Sensor and perception systems for environmental awareness
- Actuator and control systems for robot actuation
- Basic locomotion patterns and movement strategies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand forward and inverse kinematics in humanoid robots
2. Explain different sensor systems and their applications
3. Describe various actuator technologies and control approaches
4. Implement basic locomotion patterns in simulation

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 chapters:
1. **Chapter 2.1**: Kinematics and Movement Systems
2. **Chapter 2.2**: Sensors and Perception Systems
3. **Chapter 2.3**: Actuators and Control Systems
4. **Chapter 2.4**: Basic Locomotion Patterns

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental components of humanoid robotics.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed Module 1 and be familiar with Physical AI concepts and have your simulation environment set up.
