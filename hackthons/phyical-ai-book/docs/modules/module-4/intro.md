# Module 4: Applications and Integration

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on advanced applications, system integration, and real-world deployment considerations for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- Human-robot interaction principles and design patterns
- Multi-sensor fusion techniques
- Real-world deployment challenges and considerations
- Integration of all concepts in a comprehensive capstone project

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Design effective human-robot interaction systems
2. Implement multi-sensor fusion approaches
3. Address real-world deployment challenges
4. Integrate all concepts learned into a complete robot system

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 chapters:
1. **Chapter 4.1**: Human-Robot Interaction
2. **Chapter 4.2**: Multi-Sensor Fusion
3. **Chapter 4.3**: Real-World Deployment Considerations
4. **Chapter 4.4**: Capstone Project - Complete Robot System

Each chapter builds upon all previous modules, culminating in a comprehensive capstone project that integrates all concepts from the course.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed Modules 1, 2, and 3 and be familiar with all fundamental and advanced concepts in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
