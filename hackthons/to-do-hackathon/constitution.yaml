  name: The Evolution of Todo
  phase: Phase I - Todo In-Memory Python Console App
  description: A command-line todo application that stores tasks entirely in memory
  date: January 02, 2026

overview:
  theme: This project simulates the real-world evolution of software, starting with a simple script and progressing toward a Kubernetes-managed, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.
  focus: Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks entirely in memory (no persistence; data is lost when the program exits).

objectives:
  - Implement a fully functional in-memory todo console application
  - Demonstrate adherence to spec-driven development methodology
  - Showcase the Agentic Dev Stack workflow (Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via AI)
  - Follow clean code principles and Python best practices

features:
  add_task:
    description: Add a task with title and description
    acceptance_criteria:
      - User can add a task with a unique incremental integer ID (starting from 1)
      - Title is required and must be a non-empty string
      - Description is optional
      - Completed status defaults to false
      - Proper error handling for empty titles
  delete_task:
    description: Delete a task by ID
    acceptance_criteria:
      - User can delete a task by specifying its ID
      - Proper error handling for non-existent IDs
  update_task:
    description: Update task details (title and/or description) by ID
    acceptance_criteria:
      - User can update title and/or description of a task by specifying its ID
      - Proper error handling for non-existent IDs
      - Validation to ensure title is not empty if being updated
  view_tasks:
    description: View/List all tasks with status indicators
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Display all tasks with ID, title, status indicator ([ ] for incomplete, [x] for complete), and description preview
      - Show "No tasks" message if the list is empty
  mark_task:
    description: Mark a task as complete or incomplete by ID
    acceptance_criteria:
      - User can mark a task as complete or incomplete by specifying its ID
      - Proper error handling for non-existent IDs

user_interface:
  type: Interactive console application
  interaction: Menu-driven or command-based loop
  commands:
    - "add: Add a new task"
    - "delete: Delete a task by ID"
    - "update: Update task details by ID"
    - "list: View all tasks"
    - "complete: Mark a task as complete"
    - "incomplete: Mark a task as incomplete"
    - "quit: Exit the application"

data_model:
  task_structure:
    id: Unique incremental integer ID (starting from 1)
    title: Required non-empty string
    description: Optional string
    completed: Boolean, default false
  storage: In-memory using Python data structures (list/dict)

technical_constraints:
  - No external dependencies beyond the Python standard library
  - Follow clean code principles: PEP 8 compliance, meaningful names, modularity, docstrings, type hints
  - Use Python 3.13+ features where appropriate
  - No manual coding or editing of generated code is allowed

tech_stack:
  package_management: UV
  language: Python 3.13+
  spec_management: Spec-Kit Plus
  code_generation: Qwen Code (primary) and Claude Code (for planning/specs)

project_structure:
  expected_directories:
    - src/: Contains all AI-generated Python source code
    - specs_history/: Contains all specification files and iterations
  expected_files:
    - constitution.yaml: This file at the root
    - README.md: Project overview, setup instructions, and feature demonstration

deliverables:
  - constitution.yaml at the root of the repository
  - specs_history/ folder with all specification files and iterations
  - src/ folder with all AI-generated Python source code
  - README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and feature demonstration

evaluation_criteria:
  process: The process (prompts, spec iterations, planning quality) will be reviewed
  methodology: Adherence to spec-driven development methodology
  tooling: Overall use of Spec-Kit Plus and AI Code tools
  quality: Quality of specifications, plans, and generated code
