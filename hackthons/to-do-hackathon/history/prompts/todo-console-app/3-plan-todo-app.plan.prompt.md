## Prompt

Todo In-Memory Python Console App - Phase I

Create: 
- High-level architecture sketch (components and data flow)
- Proposed project file/module structure
- Execution flow (program startup → menu loop → operations → exit)
- Task storage implementation approach
- Step-by-step user interaction flow

Decisions needing documentation:
- Data model choice: list of dictionaries vs. dataclass vs. namedtuple (evaluate simplicity, type safety, readability)
- ID management: incremental counter vs. max(existing) + 1 after deletions (tradeoffs for gaps vs. simplicity)
- Modularity level: single file vs. multiple modules (e.g., separate todo_manager.py, ui.py, models.py)
- Menu implementation: function-based dispatch vs. dictionary of handlers vs. simple if-elif chain
- Input handling: raw input() with validation loops vs. helper functions for safe input
- Status indicator format: "[ ]" / "[x]" vs. "Incomplete/Complete" text (user experience vs. brevity)

Testing strategy:
- Manual validation against success criteria from /sp.specify
- For each of the 5 core features: define specific test scenarios (happy path + error cases)
- Edge cases to verify: empty list, invalid ID, empty title on add, update/delete on non-existent ID, toggle complete multiple times
- Overall flow: full run-through of adding → listing → updating → marking → deleting → listing again
- Clean exit and confirmation that data is lost on restart

Technical details:
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Dependencies: None (standard library only)
- Storage: In-memory list, no persistence
- Interface: Menu-driven console loop with numbered options (1-6, including Exit)
- Entry point: src/main.py with if __name__ == "__main__": guard
- Development approach: Purely agentic — all code generated by Qwen Code from tasks derived from this plan
- Iterative refinement: Allow revisiting plan if implementation reveals gaps

Execution phases:
1. Setup project structure and entry point
2. Define data model and storage manager
3. Implement core task operations (add, list, update, delete, mark complete)
4. Build interactive menu and input handling
5. Integrate components and polish user experience
6. Create README.md with UV instructions and usage guide

Deliverables from this plan:
- Clear module/file layout for src/
- Ordered sequence of implementation tasks ready for /sp.tasks
- Rationale for all architectural decisions
- Validation checklist aligned with success criteria

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Todo In-Memory Python Console App, including:

1. Filled in the implementation plan template with project details
2. Created research.md documenting key architectural decisions:
   - Data model choice (dataclass)
   - ID management approach
   - Project modularity
   - Menu implementation
   - Input handling
   - Status indicator format
3. Created data-model.md with Task entity definition and TodoList collection
4. Created quickstart.md with setup and usage instructions
5. Created contracts directory with API contracts document
6. Updated the implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, and project structure

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete planning artifacts for the todo app implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task breakdown with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the todo app with proper architecture and documentation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Break the plan into specific implementation tasks with /sp.tasks
