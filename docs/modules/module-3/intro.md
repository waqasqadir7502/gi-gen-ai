# Module 3: Control and Intelligence

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module delves into advanced control systems and intelligent behaviors for humanoid robots, covering stability, navigation, manipulation, and learning-based approaches.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- Balance and stability control methods for humanoid robots
- Path planning and navigation algorithms
- Manipulation and grasping techniques
- Learning-based control approaches

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Implement balance and stability control using ZMP and other methods
2. Apply path planning algorithms for navigation tasks
3. Design manipulation and grasping strategies
4. Use learning-based approaches for robot control

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 chapters:
1. **Chapter 3.1**: Balance and Stability Control
2. **Chapter 3.2**: Path Planning and Navigation
3. **Chapter 3.3**: Manipulation and Grasping
4. **Chapter 3.4**: Learning-Based Control

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of advanced control and intelligence for humanoid robotics.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed Modules 1 and 2 and be familiar with Physical AI fundamentals, kinematics, and basic locomotion.
